# OpenTx GoogleTTS soundpack generator

## What is it?

This is a Python script that can convert an Excel document into a Soundpack for your OpenTX Radio.

It uses Google's Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate high quality voices.

## Setup

The setup is not as easy as with other projects, thus this would go beyond the typical size of a README.

Therefore the Setup is described in detail in the [Wiki](https://github.com/florianL21/OpenTx-googleTTS-soundpack-generator/wiki).

## How do I use it?
